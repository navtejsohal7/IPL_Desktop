						<h3>Shirin Sadikot</h3>

						An essayist and journalist by profession, Shirin Hasan Sadikot is a Mass Communications major with a focus on sports writing and comparative literature. Interested in Cricket, thoughts come out of her regular reading habits and deepest intellectual concerns on the modern day sport. She writes to illustrate and to an extent define the times in which we live. She is a black and white person. She doesn t see greys. Her strength lies in the field of non-fiction writing. She does a lot of travelling and wanders the world with a pen and notebook. Off-late just laptop.

						A seasoned journalist with nearly 7 years of experience in covering Cricket, she has built an extensive network of friends across different cricketing nations, which has enabled her to do in-depth research and deliver quality articles. Her style is both simple and declarative, phrases and sentences that pop and push off one another, creating their own energy.

						While she continues to read and research about the sport, through her writings she aims to scribble down the ups and downs of the great sport Cricket.

						<h3>Prajkata Pawar</h3>

						Prajakta Pawar s passion for sports saw her give up a career in Social Work and take up sports journalism.

						<h3>Rajneesh Gupta</h3>

						Rajneesh Gupta is one of the most outstanding Cricket statisticians of modern time, with his unique style of presenting Cricket facts and figures. His mastery across various media platforms electronic, print, LIVE TV production is mindboggling. Ever since he joined the editorial team, Rajneesh has played an important part in the site s popularity with his in-depth analysis and superior research. His role requires him to keep a tab on each and every development in all formats of the game; but he has no qualms in admitting that it is the shortest version of Cricket that fascinates him the most.


						<h3>Arun Gopalakrishnan</h3>

						Arun Gopalakrishnan was bitten by the Cricket bug during his formative years when he spent almost every weekend playing tennis ball Cricket. That passion and hunger only increased as he grew up, and he took to playing league cricket in Bangalore. When realization dawned on him that he was going nowhere where playing was concerned, he took to other avenues within the ambit of the game. He is sort of an all-rounder where Cricket is concerned; apart from being a freelance journalist, he is also a statistician, a State Panel Umpire in Bangalore, an International Panel Scorer and a keen analyst of the game. Unlike many in his age-group early 30s he is a Test cricket romantic and prefers prolonged contests between bat and ball. Put briefly, cricket is life for him everything else comes next.
